### Plugin API
Plugins need to export two functions:
* `name()`, returning the name of the restaurant as a string, and
* `food(api, date)`, returning a list of `Food` objects representing
  the restaurants offerings on the given date.

`Food` objects are created using the function
`api.food(dish, dish_description)`.

For convenience, `api` also contains the following:
* `soup`: reexport of `bs4.BeautifulSoup`
* `requests`: reexport of `requests`
